### Assignment 2: Conceptual Data Model for Food Assistance Non-Profit



This assignment involves developing a conceptual data model for a local non-profit organization that provides food assistance to the homeless and others in need. The goal is to create a data model that supports tracking food donations and purchases, as well as managing the food inventory. The data model will help inform the database design and the user interface for a potential web application.



### Requirements
The requirements for the data model are as follows:

1. Track the food that is either donated or purchased.
2. If a food item is donated, track its donor and the donor's name, address, email, and phone, as well as a contact person if the donor is an organization or company.
3. Food items are perishable, so track the expiration date and use-by date.
4. For food items, track a name, description, and some kind of unique identifier, plus the "brand" or manufacturer.
5. For food items, track the packing type (wrapped, sealed, canned, open).
6. Track the serving size and the calories per serving size.


### Conclusion
This data model provides a conceptual representation of the entities and relationships necessary to support the tracking of food donations and purchases for the food assistance non-profit. It serves as a foundation for further database design and application development.
