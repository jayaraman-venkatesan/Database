### Assignment 3: Relational Schema Design and 3NF Compliance


This assignment involves designing a relational schema in the form of a Crow's Foot ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) that adheres to at least 3NF (Third Normal Form). Additionally, the assignment requires providing proofs of 3NF compliance by listing the functional dependencies and demonstrating that the list meets the requirements of 3NF. Finally, a PDF file containing the revised ERD and the proofs of 3NF compliance must be submitted.



### Schema Design and 3NF Compliance

The following steps were followed to design the relational schema and ensure 3NF compliance:

- Analyze the requirements and identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
-  Normalize the data to eliminate redundancy and dependencies.
- Create tables based on the normalized data, ensuring each table represents a single entity or relationship.
- Establish primary and foreign key relationships between tables to maintain data integrity.

For this assignment, the many-to-many relationships were resolved to adhere to 3NF. Instead of directly representing the many-to-many relationships in the schema, intermediary tables were introduced to break them down into one-to-many relationships.

The provided PDF file contains the revised ERD and demonstrates the 3NF compliance by including the following:

- The Crow's Foot ERD, illustrating the entities, relationships, and attributes.
- The functional dependencies listed for each table, showing the relationships between attributes.
- The proofs of 3NF compliance, highlighting how the functional dependencies meet the requirements of 3NF.

### File description 

1. Unnormatized Model shows the intial model in consideration that is to be changed to adhere to the requirements

2. Normalized-with-proof is a pdf containing the new model with glossary and proof for all the normal forms

### Conclusion

This assignment focused on designing a relational schema in the form of a Crow's Foot ERD that adheres to at least 3NF. By carefully analyzing the requirements, normalizing the data, and establishing key relationships, the resulting schema ensures data integrity and minimizes redundancy. The submitted PDF file provides a comprehensive overview of the schema design, including the revised ERD and the proofs of 3NF compliance.
